# ✈️ Flight Analysis Report – Delay & Performance Insights  

## Project Overview  
This **Power BI** report provides an in-depth analysis of **flight delays and performance trends**, identifying key factors affecting flight punctuality and airport efficiency. The project includes **data cleaning, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations** to uncover insights that help optimize air travel operations.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & reporting  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning & transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Creating calculated measures  
- **GitHub** – Version control & project sharing  

## Dashboard Structure  
The report consists of **two main pages**, each focusing on a different aspect of flight analysis:  

 **Flight Delays & Performance Overview** – Examines delay patterns, flight punctuality, and the most influential factors causing delays.  
 **Airport-Specific Details & Delayed Flights** – Provides detailed insights into each airport, including delay statistics and key performance metrics.  

## Data Cleaning Process  
During the data preparation phase, several **inconsistencies and errors** were identified and resolved:  
    **Fixed incorrect delay values**, such as **negative delay times**.  
    **Handled missing data**
